notepad .gitignore
```

This file tells Git what NOT to track/commit. Super important for keeping your passwords and personal data safe!

---

**Ignore database files (contains all your personal tasks/goals):**
```
# Database files - contains all your personal data
db/
```

**What this does:**
- The `db/` folder has your entire PostgreSQL database
- This includes all your tasks, goals, weights, study progress - everything!
- You DON'T want this on GitHub

---

**Ignore uploaded files:**
```
# Uploaded files and attachments
files/
```

**What this does:**
- Any files you upload to Vikunja (screenshots, PDFs, etc.) go here
- Also personal data that shouldn't be public

---

**Ignore environment files with secrets:**
```
# Environment files with secrets
.env
.env.local
```

**What this does:**
- Some people use `.env` files to store passwords instead of putting them directly in `docker-compose.yml`
- Even though we're not using these now, good to have for future expansion
- Prevents accidentally committing secrets

---

**Ignore backup files:**
```
# Backups
*.tar.gz
*.sql
*.dump
```

**What this does:**
- When you backup your database, these are common file extensions
- `*.tar.gz` = compressed archive files
- `*.sql` = database dumps
- `*.dump` = PostgreSQL backup files

---

**Ignore OS-specific files:**
```
# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
```

**What this does:**
- `.DS_Store` = macOS creates these in every folder (annoying!)
- `Thumbs.db` = Windows thumbnail cache
- These aren't harmful but clutter your repo

---

**Ignore editor files:**
```
# Editor files
*.swp
*.swo
*~
.vscode/
.idea/
```

**What this does:**
- `*.swp`, `*.swo` = Vim editor temporary files
- `*~` = Backup files from various editors
- `.vscode/` = VS Code settings (personal preferences)
- `.idea/` = JetBrains IDE settings

---

**Ignore log files:**
```
# Logs
*.log
